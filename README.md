# docker-pac (DEPRECATED)

Old repository for Docker file and readme for the [praqma/pac image](https://hub.docker.com/r/praqma/pac).

Never versions are maintained and released from the [Praqmatic Automated Changelog tool repository](https://github.com/Praqma/Praqmatic-Automated-Changelog).

The older version of the praqma/pac image (tagged v3, v4, v18, v20) are only Ruby environments fitted to run older versions of PAC. In those versions you would have to mount in the PAC Ruby script yourself.
Those images do not work with never versions (2.x and forward).

You can check out those version from here and they are tagged as releases.


If you wan't to see the old documentation and the content of the repository, go back by using tags og git commit history.
